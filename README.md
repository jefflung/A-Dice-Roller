Worksheet 7-Object-Oriented Programming

[ASSESSMENT] Question 4: A Dice Roller (class_roll.py)
Letâ€™s now implement a dice roller as a reusable program component in the spirit of the previous question.
1.	Create a new class called DiceRoller with a constructor that takes 1 argument num_of_dice that it stores as an attribute.
2.	Now, add a function to your class called roll() that rolls num_of_dice dice and returns the value of the roll. For example, if num_of_dice is 2, then 2 random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated, added together and returned as a value from 2-12. 
3.	Now, add another function to your class called roll_many() that takes an argument n and returns a list containing the results of calling roll() n times.
4.	As for question 3, from your week 3 exercise on dice rolling, copy your solution across and integrate your new reusable DiceRoller class, imported from a separate file as before.
